My name is Chris and I'm the CTO and Co-Founder of triply. In my free time  - which i have far too little of - I read books 📖, take photos 📷, do sports 🏃‍♂️and sit in front of a computer 💻 far too much. 

I love travelling 🌇 (when there's no world-wide pandemic happening 🦠), learning languages (currently Chinese 汉语) and cooking (also Chinese 🍚).
