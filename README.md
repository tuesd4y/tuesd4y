My name is Chris and I'm the CTO and Co-Founder of triply. In my free time  - which i have far too little of - I read books 📖, take photos 📷, do sports 🏃‍♂️and sit in front of a computer 💻 far too much. I sometimes write about code at [tuesd4y.com](https://tuesd4y.com).

I love travelling 🌇 (when there's no world-wide pandemic happening 🦠), learning languages (currently Chinese 汉语) and cooking (also Chinese 🍚). Monthly challenges like [#30dayMapChallenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge) and [#AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com) are awesome too!

 If you want to get in contact with me, just **DM me on twitter!**

### 📚 Technologies I Use 📚 

I started getting very much into coding writing Java Backend and Android Applications, and have been hyping up kotlin ever since 2015 :)

- I write Android Apps (first in Java, now of course in kotlin)
- I do some frontend stuff with Angular and created my multiple sites using Jamstack
- I create backend code with spring boot and kotlin
- I define, create, implement and interface with APIs and databases (e.g. Postgres)
- I spend far too much time defining APIs in OAS, thinking about software architecture and wrestling JIRA
- I've been learning more and more about qGIS, spatial analysis and data science in python 🐍 
- I love writing in markdown ([Typora](https://typora.io) is the best piece of software ever invented)
- Sometimes I even write tests, and sometimes they even run

### 🌿 What I Do at triply 🌿

- At [triply](https://triply.at) we help municipalities and regions understand and improve how their citizens move around
- We started triply for organizing better trips to events and festivals, but now also want to help improve rural mobility
- I built the first version of our Android app (in kotlin) and backend service (spring boot + Postgres)
- In the last three years, we've become an internatial team of more than 10 awesome persons
- Nowadays, I spend a lot of time planning and coordinating technical development, but am always happy when I can do some coding :)
